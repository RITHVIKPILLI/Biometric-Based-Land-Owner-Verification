BIOMETRIC BASED LAND OWNER VERIFICATION
Land forgery cases are increasing in our day by day and we are unable to find the person who is trying to claim falsely and who is the real owner. 
People are finding a way to create fake documents to claim for the land which they donâ€™t even own. So to get a proper solution they are approaching
court cases in such land dispute take a lot of time to find the actual owner.So I came up with the idea of biometric verification which can solve or
avoid the land forgery. We can easily find who is the real land owner by verifying their identity through biometric which take less than 10 minutes 
and saves time comparatively when approached through court case.

(Note: Before running this project, follow these steps:

      2.Start the Server:
         Open XAMPP after installation.
         Start the Apache and MySQL services.
      3.Verify Installation
        Open your browser and go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
        If the phpMyAdmin page loads successfully, your XAMPP installation is complete and configured correctly.)
      
****************Steps to Set Up and Run the Project*******************
1.Place the Project Folder in the Correct Location:
  -->Ensure the entire project folder is placed inside the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\ on Windows).
  -->This step is crucial for the project to be accessible via the localhost server.
2.Open verify.php and Enter Existing Details:
  -->Locate the verify.php file in the project folder.
  -->Open it and provide the details of records that already exist in the database.
3.Verify XAMPP Configuration:
  -->Ensure that XAMPP is installed and properly configured.
  -->Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
  -->Open your browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin to check if phpMyAdmin loads correctly.
4.Create and Populate the Database:
  -->In phpMyAdmin, create a new database table with the name data.
  -->Import the data.sql file from the project folder into the data table.
  -->Once the import is complete, you should see the data populated in the table.
5.Run the Project:
  -->Enter the data that already exists in the database into verify.php.
  -->Follow the stepwise flow of the project as outlined in the project folder to see the functionality in action.
